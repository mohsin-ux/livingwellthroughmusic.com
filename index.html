                <p>My journey into music therapy was inspired by a personal experience that ignited my passion for
                    helping others. Following my diagnosis of prostate cancer in 2016 and an arteriovenous malformation
                    (AVM) on the brain, both detected early and successfully treated, I embarked on a path to follow my
                    dreams. These challenges underscored the importance of healing and motivated me to retrain as a
                    music therapist. I have also taught piano, guitar and drums for over twenty years in private
                    settings and as a creative music lead in mainstream and specialist schools. </p>
