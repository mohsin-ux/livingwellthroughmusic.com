                <p>I am Alphonso Archer, a professional HCPC registered music therapist in Calne, UK.
                    <br><br>With a master's degree in music therapy from the University of the West of England (UWE), I
                    bring a
                    wealth of knowledge and expertise to my practice. As a dedicated member of the British Association
                    for Music Therapy (BAMT) and The Black, African and Asian Therapy Network (BAATN), I stay at the
                    forefront of developments in the field.

            <div class="innerbox">
                <p>My journey into music therapy was inspired by a personal experience that ignited my passion for
                    helping others. Following my diagnosis of prostate cancer in 2016 and an arteriovenous malformation
                    (AVM) on the brain, both detected early and successfully treated, I embarked on a path to follow my
                    dreams. These challenges underscored the importance of healing and motivated me to retrain as a
                    music therapist. I have also taught piano, guitar and drums for over twenty years in private
                    settings and as a creative music lead in mainstream and specialist schools. </p>

                <p>I have worked extensively with diverse clients, including children with autism, adults with mental
                    health issues, and older adults with dementia. My experience spans a wide range of settings,

                    music events to generate funds for this vital cause. This personal connection fuels my dedication to
                    making a difference in the lives of my clients and the broader community.

                <p>Growing up with a father diagnosed with schizophrenia has deeply influenced my perspective on mental
                    health issues. It has nurtured a profound interest and empathy for those facing similar challenges,
                    motivating me to specialise in this area within my music therapy practice. I firmly believe that
                    music possesses the extraordinary power to forge connections on a soulful level, facilitating
                    healing and fostering personal growth.</p>

            <div class="innerbox">
                <p>In addition to my therapeutic work, I am actively involved in advocacy and awareness-raising
                    initiatives concerning mental health, autism, social justice, and race. With over seven years of
                    experience creatively using music to support children with autism, I have gained invaluable insights
                    into neurodiversity, selective mutism, ADHD, identity, intergenerational trauma, and mental health
                    issues.</p>

                    all backgrounds embark on their healing journeys and find profound meaning through the
                    transformative power of music. My expertise in working with issues surrounding identity,
                    intergenerational trauma, and autism and my active involvement in BAMT and BAATN exemplify my
                    unwavering commitment to promoting cultural awareness, social justice, and healing within my
